\subsection{Apache Calcite vision}
\label{subsec:vision}

The technical contributions of Calcite:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Open source friendly. Being written in Java, with Apache license, in ASF. So is the idea that code is divided into re-usable units (e.g. rules).
	\item More than one engine (Volcano, Hep) that run off the same rules. You can construct a multi-phase optimization process, using different engines, cost models and sets of traits (physical properties) in each phase. Rules can be re-used across phases (e.g. one phase might pull up projects, another might push them down).
	\item Streaming, and in particular integration of streaming and non-streaming data.
	\item The \textit{calling convention} trait, and plans that cross multiple engines. Calling convention is a physical property. And therefore it has a enforcer.
	\item Support for standard SQL, and also various dialects of SQL (e.g. Oracle SQL), case-sensitivity of identifiers, identifier quoting schemes.
	\item Avatica JDBC framework
	\item Metadata caching.
\end{itemize}
