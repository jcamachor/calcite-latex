\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

The challenge is not only the explosion of data size, but other factors like heterogeneity and velocity are decisive.
In recent years there has been a Cambrian explosion in the number of data processing systems that deal with these challenges.
While there might be differences in the processing capabilities of these systems, it is valuable to propose a common layer of abstraction or framework that can integrate and optimize with these systems.

Examples:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Integrating in-memory data (and a programming language model like LINQ) with a database-like approach (based on relational algebra).
	\item Hybrid queries (crossing multiple systems and memory).
	\item Materialized views, especially for OLAP applications, and especially dynamic (i.e. caching query results or intermediate results, and disabled when segments are flushed out of memory).
\end{itemize}
