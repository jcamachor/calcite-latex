\section{Next steps}
\label{sec:future}

As we have described previously in Section~\ref{sec:action}, Calcite is enjoying wide adoption across the industry, and we would like to take advantage of this traction to continue pushing the project forward. In this Section, we expose some goals that we are currently working on, or that we would like to pursue in the near future. 

\myparagraph{Mutation.} While Calcite is incredibly useful for performing cross-database optimization, it is not currently possible to handle mutation.
The query processing capabilities of Calcite can be useful in selecting which rows in a table need to be updated.
An interface for performing these updates would serve to make Calcite usable as an interface to a wider range of applications.

\myparagraph{Parallel optimization.}


\myparagraph{Importance metric for rules.}
